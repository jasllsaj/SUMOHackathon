Ideas so far:
- digital literacy
- helping vision impaired people pick items off shelves
    - segment and classification of items 
- indoor navigation (e.g. shopping centres, individual supermarkets)
    - incorporate computer vision to read off aisle numbers?
    - in-store map or something built off Google maps
