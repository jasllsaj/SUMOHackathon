 Ideas so far:
- digital literacy
- helping vision impaired people pick items off shelves
    - segment and classification of items 


- indoor navigation (e.g. shopping centres, individual supermarkets)
    - incorporate computer vision to read off aisle numbers?
    - in-store map or something built off Google maps

Importance of in-store navigation:
    - Retail stores are increasingly competing online shopping giants like Amazon
    - People will shop online if it is easier to do so
    - Elderly people, visually impaired people may also have a hard time reading store maps, wayfinding signage
    - elderly people may not be familiar with online shopping so don't have another alternative
    - smaller businesses without an online presence may also lose out if too many people favour bigger retailers with online stores
    - incentivise people to visit stores, increase foot traffic etc. to support retail jobs
    - retail industry has already taken a hit due to COVID-19 pandemic, online stores have seen a boom

Implementation:
    - free mobile app?
    - decision: individual stores? or shopping centres?
    - could potentially monetise with advertisements for nearby stores
    - integrated item search with store catalogue/stock levels
    - location services to find the particular store then fetch store details
    - provide further incentives with occasional deals/discounts targeted to user
    - Wi-Fi signals to triangulate user location?
        - Can make use of Apple's Indoor Maps Program https://register.apple.com/resources/indoor/Apple-Indoor-Maps-Guidelines.pdf
